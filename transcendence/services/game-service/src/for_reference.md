To use **WebSocket** with your game engine for real-time updates, you need to:

1. **Add a WebSocket server to your backend** (alongside Fastify).
2. **Broadcast game state changes** (like paddle/ball positions, scores, game start/end) to all connected clients.
3. **Have your frontend connect to the WebSocket and update the UI when messages arrive.**

---

### 1. **Backend: Add WebSocket to Fastify**

You can use the [`fastify-websocket`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-websocket) plugin or the native [`ws`](https://github.com/websockets/ws) package.

**Example with `fastify-websocket`:**

```javascript
// Install: npm install fastify-websocket

import Fastify from 'fastify';
import fastifyWebsocket from 'fastify-websocket';

const fastify = Fastify();
fastify.register(fastifyWebsocket);

let clients = [];

fastify.get('/ws', { websocket: true }, (connection /* SocketStream */, req) => {
  clients.push(connection.socket);

  connection.socket.on('close', () => {
    clients = clients.filter(c => c !== connection.socket);
  });
});

// Function to broadcast game state to all clients
function broadcastGameState(gameState) {
  const message = JSON.stringify({ type: 'gameState', data: gameState });
  clients.forEach(ws => {
    if (ws.readyState === 1) ws.send(message);
  });
}

// Example: Call broadcastGameState(gameState) whenever the game state updates
```

---

### 2. **Frontend: Connect and Listen**

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000/ws');

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (msg.type === 'gameState') {
    // Update your UI with msg.data (the new game state)
  }
};
```

---

### 3. **When to Broadcast**

- Call `broadcastGameState(gameState)` **every time the game state changes** (e.g., after paddle/ball movement, score update, game start/end).
- You can also send specific events (like "game started", "game ended", etc.) if needed.

---

### **Summary**

- Add a WebSocket endpoint to your Fastify server.
- Broadcast game state changes to all connected clients.
- Frontend listens for updates and renders the new state in real time.

Yes, in your setup **all services, including the frontend, are containers** and **belong to the same Docker network** (`transcendence-network`).

- The **frontend** container is part of the Docker network, so it can communicate with other services by their service names (e.g., `gateway:3000`, `game-service:3002`).
- **Best practice:** The frontend should always send API and WebSocket requests to the **gateway** (e.g., `http://gateway:3000` or `ws://gateway:3000/ws`), not directly to other backend services.
- The **gateway** then routes requests to the appropriate microservice (like `game-service`).

**Why?**

- This keeps your architecture secure, maintainable, and scalable.
- The gateway can handle authentication, logging, and routing for all services.
- In production, only the gateway is exposed to the outside world; other services remain internal.

**Summary:**

- The frontend **is** part of the Docker network.
- The frontend should **always go through the gateway** for API/WebSocket communication.
- The gateway handles routing to the game engine and other services.



## Option 1: Run a New Game via API {how to run a new game}

You can create and end a new game using your API endpoints:

**1. Create a new game:**

bash

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/games \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"\
  -d '{"player1_id": 1, "player2_id": 2}'
```

This will return something like:

json

```json
{"id":2}
```

**2. End the game with a score:**

bash

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/games/2/end \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"\
  -d '{
    "winner_id": 1,
    "final_score": {"player1": 11, "player2": 7}
  }'
```

---

From your code, the `gameState` is assumed to look like this:

<pre class="overflow-visible!" data-start="768" data-end="1133"><div class="contain-inline-size rounded-2xl relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary"><div class="sticky top-9"><div class="absolute end-0 bottom-0 flex h-9 items-center pe-2"><div class="bg-token-bg-elevated-secondary text-token-text-secondary flex items-center gap-4 rounded-sm px-2 font-sans text-xs"></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="whitespace-pre! language-javascript"><span><span>gameState = {
  </span><span>paddles</span><span>: {
    </span><span>player1</span><span>: </span><span>0</span><span>,  </span><span>// vertical position of player1 paddle</span><span>
    </span><span>player2</span><span>: </span><span>0</span><span></span><span>// vertical position of player2 paddle</span><span>
  },
  </span><span>ball</span><span>: {
    </span><span>x</span><span>: </span><span>0</span><span>,    </span><span>// horizontal position</span><span>
    </span><span>y</span><span>: </span><span>0</span><span>,    </span><span>// vertical position</span><span>
    </span><span>vx</span><span>: </span><span>1</span><span>,   </span><span>// horizontal velocity</span><span>
    </span><span>vy</span><span>: </span><span>1</span><span></span><span>// vertical velocity</span><span>
  },
  </span><span>score</span><span>: {
    </span><span>player1</span><span>: </span><span>0</span><span>,
    </span><span>player2</span><span>: </span><span>0</span><span>
  }
};
</span></span></code></div></div></pre>

* `ball.x` → horizontal position of the ball
* `ball.y` → vertical position of the ball
* `ball.vx` → horizontal speed of the ball
* `ball.vy` → vertical speed of the ball

In JavaScript, objects can store **nested properties** like this; you don’t need to declare a `struct` like in C. The `ball` object is just part of `gameState`.


Great questions! Here’s a clear explanation of how it works in your setup:

---

## 1. **If you open the HTML in the browser:**

- **Yes, your browser (frontend) will connect directly to the WebSocket endpoint** (e.g., `ws://localhost:3002/game-ws`) as soon as your JavaScript runs:
  ```javascript
  const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3002/game-ws');
  ```
- This connection is independent of the REST API (`/games`).
- The browser can now send and receive real-time game updates.

---

## 2. **If someone sends a request to the gateway (e.g., POST /games):**

- The gateway forwards the request to the game-service’s `/games` endpoint.
- The game-service creates a new game object and returns it (with an ID, player info, etc).
- **This is just a REST API call. No WebSocket is involved yet.**

---

## 3. **How does the WebSocket connection start?**

- **WebSocket connections are started by the client (browser or app) using JavaScript.**
- After creating a game (via `/games`), your frontend should connect to the WebSocket endpoint (e.g., `ws://localhost:3002/game-ws`).
- This is usually done automatically in your frontend code, for example:
  ```javascript
  // After creating a game via POST /games
  const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3002/game-ws');
  ```
- The WebSocket connection is **not started automatically by the backend**.
  The client (browser/app) must initiate it.

---

## 4. **Typical Flow**

1. **User opens the game page in the browser.**
2. **Frontend sends POST /games** (via gateway) to create a new game.
3. **Frontend receives the game info** (e.g., game ID).
4. **Frontend connects to WebSocket** (`ws://localhost:3002/game-ws`) to receive real-time updates and send actions.
5. **Gameplay happens over WebSocket** (move paddle, start game, etc).

---

## 5. **Summary Table**

| Action                        | How it happens                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Create game                   | HTTP POST /games (via gateway)   |
| Connect to WebSocket          | Client JS:`new WebSocket(...)` |
| Receive/send real-time events | Over WebSocket connection        |

---

**Key Point:**

- **WebSocket connections are always started by the client (browser/app), not by the backend or REST API.**
- **REST endpoints** are for creating games, getting info, etc.
- **WebSocket** is for real-time gameplay and updates.

---

If you want the frontend to connect to the correct game, you can pass the game ID as a query parameter or in the first WebSocket message.
